# secrets

Golang package to securely save passwords, keys, and other sensitive data.

This package provides a simple and secure way for developers to handle
sensitive information like passwords and API keys without needing deep
cryptographic expertise. It encrypts and stores data persistently,
ensuring availability across program restarts and protecting against
corruption from multiple process access.

## Features
- Secure encryption and decryption of sensitive data.
- Persistent storage of secrets on disk.
- Thread-safe and process-safe access to secrets.
- Support for key rotation to enhance security.
- Ability to create password-protected tarballs of secret stores for portability.

## Installation

To install the `secrets` package, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/fletcher13/secrets
```

## Usage

### Creating or Opening a Secret Store

To create a new `secrets.Store` or open an existing one, use
`secrets.NewStore(dirpath string, key []byte)`.

- If `dirpath` is an empty directory, a new store will be initialized there.
- If `dirpath` contains an existing `.secretskeys` file, the store will be
	opened for use.
- An error will be returned if `dirpath` is not empty and does not contain
	a secrets store.

The `key` parameter is crucial for decrypting the store's internal
keys. It's recommended to derive this key securely, for example, using a
key derivation function like PBKDF2 from a user-provided password.

### Suggestions

TODO: Add detailed instructions for possible secure "unit" keys.

Never put sensitive data in a string, always use a byte slice.  Byte
slices can be zeroed when the data is no longer needed, but strings
cannot be zeroed in Go.

Use the `secrets.Wipe()` function to zero out sensitive data when that
data is no longer needed.  This is required for FIPS-140 and Common
Criteria compliance.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"

	"github.com/fletcher13/secrets"
)

func main() {
	// Example: Use a simple key for demonstration. In a real application,
	// derive this securely (e.g., from a password using PBKDF2).
	encryptionKey := []byte("a-very-secret-key-that-is-at-least-32-bytes-long")

	// Create a temporary directory for the secret store
	dir, err := ioutil.TempDir("", "secret_store")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error creating temp directory: %v\n", err)
		return
	}
	defer os.RemoveAll(dir) // Clean up the directory when done

	store, err := secrets.NewStore(dir, encryptionKey)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error creating/opening store: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Save sensitive data
	secretPath := "my/api/key"
	sensitiveData := []byte("my_super_secret_api_key_123")
	err = store.Save(secretPath, sensitiveData)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error saving secret: %v\n", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("Secret saved to %s\n", secretPath)

	// Load sensitive data
	loadedData, err := store.Load(secretPath)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error loading secret: %v\n", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("Loaded secret: %s\n", string(loadedData))
}
```

### Key Rotation

The `store.Rotate()` method allows you to generate a new encryption key for the store and re-encrypt all existing data with the new key. This is a crucial security feature for regularly updating your encryption keys.

## Implementation Details

Every `secrets.Store` directory contains a `.secretskeys` subdirectory. This directory manages the encryption keys for the store.

### Key Management

In the `.secretskeys` directory, you will find:
- `currentkey`: A single byte file indicating which key number (0-255) is currently used for newly encrypted data.
- `key<N>`: One or more binary files, where `<N>` is a number between 0 and 255. Each `key<N>` file contains the encryption key for that index. The first byte of a `key<N>` file indicates the encryption algorithm used (currently, only algorithm 0, AES256GCM, is defined), followed by the key itself, which is intended to be encrypted by a secure system like TPM2.0. If TPM2.0 or similar is unavailable, a less secure "unit key" might be used.

### Data Storage

All other files in the `secrets.Store` directory are encrypted user data. When `store.Save(path, data)` is called:
- The `path` is cleaned using `filepath.Clean` and validated to ensure it remains within the store's hierarchy.
- The `data` is encrypted.
- The first byte of the saved data file indicates the key number used for encryption, followed by the encrypted data.

### Store Initialization and Key Generation

When `secrets.NewStore()` is called on an empty directory:
- It initializes `currentkey` to 0.
- Generates, encrypts, and saves `key0`.

### Key Rotation Process

The `store.Rotate()` function performs the following:
1. Generates a new key, incrementing the `currentkey` index (rolling over to 0 if `currentkey` is 255).
2. Saves the new key in a `key<N>` file.
3. Updates `currentkey` in the config file to point to the new key.
4. Re-encrypts all existing data in the store with the new key.
5. Deletes all old keys once all data is confirmed to be re-encrypted.

### Concurrency and Crash Recovery

The library aims to be thread-safe and process-safe using file `rwlocks`. Considerations for NFS filesystems and multi-computer safety require further research into mechanisms like `flock`.

When `NewStore()` is called:
- It verifies the existence of the `currentkey` file and associated key file.
- If multiple key files are present (indicating a potential incomplete rotation from a previous crash), a goroutine is launched to walk through the store hierarchy. This goroutine re-encrypts any data not using `currentkey` with the `currentkey`.
- To handle concurrent rotations or crashes during re-encryption, mechanisms are in place (e.g., monitoring the config file for changes via `inotify`) to stop ongoing re-encryption goroutines if a new rotation is initiated. This ensures data consistency and prevents corruption. The responsibility for updating secrets shifts to the latest rotation process.
